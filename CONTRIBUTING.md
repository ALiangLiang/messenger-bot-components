## Pull Request

I'm glad to get pull request if any functionality is missing or something is buggy.
However, there are a couple of things you can do to make life easier for the maintainers:

- Please read Messenger Platform documents first.
- Make sure that all existing tests pass.
- If you're adding a new feature or changing the exists function, remember to write
test code to ensure its work on Messenger Platform.
- If you want to change the API, please explain the reason in the PR.
